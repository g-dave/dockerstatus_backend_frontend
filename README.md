# dockerstatus_backend_frontend
this is a simple home project with an overview table, of distributed docker nodes - with all containers and their status (running, exited...)

I know this is probably full of errors and mistakes, normaly somebody who can develop would never do ;)! 
But I'm NOT A DEVELOPER, just a guy with an hobbie approach. I've tried to setup a super simple microservice environment with a dedicated frontend and a rest api backend. The worker client is a python script which sends container information, and runs native on all docker nodes (schedulled by crontab). 

I never used javascript before. Python I used before, but I have only some very very low skills. In the end it is working like it was supposed to do. So I can reuse and evolve in later projects.
